heavy-duty,3,Bennett,"I downloaded the 3D model and started working on a distance critical design with this actuator. Ordedered one and set it up, noticed it looked a little different from the model. Several critical dimensions are significantly off from the spec sheet and the 3D model. For one, the minimum distance is 0.326"" larger (longer, center to center) than specified. Travel distance is good, coming in at 3.040"" for my 3"" model. The mounting holes are not half inch, they are significantly undersized, and unmatched. Bottom hole is ID .478"" and the top hole is ID .496"". Good luck getting a 1/2"" clevis pin through that hole. Glad I checked these dimensions manually otherwise my design would have been in trouble.  The bottom mounting gap was also off. If I hadn't checked this, I would have been in trouble, so for that I give it 3 stars. The quality of the actuator itself is nice. This particular model (the heavy duty actuator) is very quiet, so you can look forward to that. Good quality really, but you MUST check the dimensions yourself.",,bennett@collectivlab.com,3/4/2022,,,no,no,,,,,,

drop-down-tv-lift,4,Vincent J Miceli,"I am using the 40"" mount with a 30"" wide diagonal monitor. When a monitor is mounted all of the weight is to the front. The movable track is only attached at one end in the current design. This causes the track to lean forward as it moves down. Its a big enough deflection that is makes it really hard to align the drywall/plywood to the ceiling hole as the monitor travels back up. I wish the design had a set of rollers at the bottom for the track to ride. This would help the track stay perfectly vertical as it travels. It would also help control some of the side to side sway when the track is in motion.",,vjm@orchardparksoftware.com,11/7/2021,,,no,no,,,,,,

premium-high-force-linear-actuators,2,Chris Barrett,"If planning to use these outdoors I would recommend installing them upside down (motor end up).  My application utilized a set of four of the 30"" stroke premium force actuators to lift a 500lb carport style roof on a boat (parked in driveway 99% of the time).  The actuators worked successfully for the first few months however all four, and two addition replacements, have all failed over a period of less then a year.  The primary issue has been rain water leaking in through the seal on the telescoping portion.  I have also had issues with the limit switches dying, sometimes upper sometimes lower.  The unit will essentially collect water until full.  Have also had issues with the motors failing, which is likely due to the water issues or from internal gears seizing from the water.  If attempting to operate and the motor has seized, these can get extremely hot to the point where the casing will burn you hand and melt plastic.  These do work and I unfortunately haven't found anything much better for the price, but wanted to share my experiences so far.",,Christopherjohnb@aol.com,7/27/2020,,,no,no,,,,,,

sit-stand-desk,5,Dan,"I almost never take the time to write reviews on anything but I was pleased enough with this purchase that I felt the need to comment.My sit-stand desk lift arrived today and right away I was pleased with how well packaged it was and how sturdy the parts seemed to be. It arrived in just a few days from ordering. It did not take long to assemble. I used a piece of 1/2inch plywood I had on hand to make a temporary top so that I could begin using it until I can make a proper top for it. Everything works great and it is quite stable even at maximum extended height. I also love the fact that it adjusts to a wide range of desk top sizes I don't have any hard numbers to give you but I believe this feels sturdier and more reliable than anything else I have been able to get my hands on as well as having a larger range of travel. I am really pleased with my purchase.  My one complaint would be that it took me a lot of looking around to stumble across Firgelli and then more chasing around on their site to discover they offered this product .

linear-drawer-slides,4,Steve,"My drawer under my work bench died a horrible death by badly deforming the 100 lb rated, side-mounted, Accuride drawer slides. To be fair the drawer was loaded to capacity (I weighed the contents at 95 lbs) and worked just fine for ten years. I decided to upgrade to 400 lb Firgelli slides, which arrived today. When unpacked, the new slides didn't look different than the old ones so I measured them and compared old to new. Same bearing size, same material thickness. Only difference is overall size - old were 1.375""x0.375"", new are 1.75""x0.5"". I don't think the larger size is going to increase the capacity by 400%. I think the new slides will easily carry the 95 lb load but I'll betcha dollars to donuts they won't handld 400 lbs as advertised and I ain't loading them until they're broken. Only time will tell but somethin' don't look right to me.",,anluan56@gmail.com,2/7/2020,,,no,no,,,,,,

Check out the project out at:  https://www.hackster.io/ndrogness/digital-garden-with-hail-protection-ed38afThe only complaint I had was that, although the actuator is water resistant, the mounting pin and bracket assembly which attach to the actuator apparently are not.  The pin was rusted after a few months of being outside exposed to the elements.  This was the only reason I didn't give it five stars.

Firgelli's desk lift systems allow you to buy just the mechanism and its a universal system that fits to any size table top.

sit-stand-desk,5,Donald Krolikowski,"Received the two leg electric height adjustable desk frame  in a well packaged, secure carton approximately seven days after placing the order. The packaging alleviates any concerns about possible damage during shipping. Unpacked and assembled following clearly written, well diagrammed instructions. There were no missing pieces or complications with assembly. I used a ready made  27 x 60 inch formica counter top purchased from a home improvement store weighing about 50 lbs. The frame accommodated the top and its weight without issue. After using the assembled desk for about ten days, which included raising and lowering several times each day, a routine press of the controller resulted in a slight skewing of the table top creating an un-level surface and display error code . I followed the troubleshooting guide and determined one of the wire connections was loose. I believe the cause was not securing the wiring harness after assembly using the supplied wire tethering friction straps. I take responsibility that. The harness has plenty of wire to accommodate various installation configurations and the weight of the unsecured wiring bundle hanging from the connector point resulted in an open contact. After closing the connection the table frame was able to reset itself and resume normal operation. I am quite satisfied with this product. It deserves five stars for quality, high value and thoughtful engineering.",,artfromdon@gmail.com,4/24/2019,,,no,no,,,,,,

Only need one screwdriver, all other parts and tools are included.The only downside is the manual. It could have been bigger, as in full pages (8.5"" X 11"") instead of the half page sizes.

heavy-duty,5,Jerry Peck,"The Chevy P-30 chassis, which was used as the chassis for many motorhomes, has an hydraulically operated auto park brake which has known issues with failing while driving ... this results in the parking brake at the output of the transmission being applied while driving.This failure is due to the hydraulic system losing pressure (the RGS, known as the Rotten Green Switch) is a common cause of failure (but is not the only cause of such failure). When the hydraulic system loses pressure, a built-in spring applies the parking brake ... which is not a good thing to have happen while driving.The 1,000 lb model, with a 3 inch stroke, makes an excellent replacement for the failure-prone hydraulic system: http://jerrypeck.com/Auto%20Park%20Brake%20Replacement.pdf Not only does it work like a charm (it works automatically just like the factory hydraulic system), the actuator holds better and on steeper grades than the hydraulic system did!Once the brake is applied, the brake stays applied; and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, once the brake is released, the brake stays released.Could not have done this fix without this actuator!",,jerrypeck@cfl.rr.com,9/8/2016,,,no,no,,,,,,
